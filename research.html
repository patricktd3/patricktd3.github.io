            <h1>Research</h1>

            <p>My primary research interest is in the use of mathematics in epidemiology. Compartmental models of infectious disease provide a highly customizable framework from which we may study the disease dynamics. For example, the well-known Kermack-McKendrick (or SIR) model divides the population according to the stage of the disease and then tracks movement between the compartments using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).</p>

            <p>In particular, I investigate how delay differential equations (DDEs) may be used to accurately model the development of an infectious disease. While similar to ODEs in many ways, DDEs result in strikingly different behavior which may help to better account for certain disease dynamics; however, incorporating DDEs makes the system even more challenging to analyze.</p>

            <p>For my PhD dissertation (defended in September 2017), I worked on a project to model the spread of an infecitous disease exhibiting susceptible-infectious-susceptible dynamics through a small metapopulation with delayed dispersal. The primary result of my work was to show that the delay parameter does not affect the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. I also used a numerical technique to find thresholds for which the system's qualitative behavior, even though the stability is preserved.</p>

            <p>As part of my dissertation, I also explored a simlar problem in a one- or two-dimensional continuous spatial region. In order to do this, I adapted frameworks given by others for modeling populations, and then added a disease structure to their concepts.</p>
            <p>Moving forward, I hope to build on this work.  With only a limited knowldege of differential equations, many undergradaute students can start to explore the world of mathematical epidemiology; and I would relish in the opportunity to help students start along that path.</p>
