                <h1>Research</h1>
                
                <p>My primary research interest is in the use of mathematics in epidemiology. Compartmental models provide a highly customizable framework from which many diseases may be studied. For example, the well-known Kermack-McKendrick (or SIR) model divides the population according to the stage of the disease and then tracks movement between the compartments using a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs).</p>
                
                <p>In particular, I investigate how delay differential equations (DDEs) may be used to accurately model the development of an infectious disease. While similar to ODEs in many ways, DDEs result in strikingly different behavior which may help to better account for certain disease dynamics; however, incorporating DDEs makes the dynamical system even more challenging to analyze.</p>
                
                <p>Currently, I am working on a project to model the spread of a disease through a metapopulation with delayed dispersal. Our preliminary numerical results indicate thresholds for which the system's behavior drastically changes. Through further analysis, we hope to determine what conditions result in an epidemic or the disease becoming endemic.</p>
                
                <p>I have also become interested in how to formulate a simlar problem in a continuous spatial region. In order to do this, I'm investigating what exatly it means to have a delayed partial differential equation.</p>

                <p>Teaching mathematics is an integral part of my own mathematical experience. (You'll have to pardon the pun.) In fact, part of the reason I decided to attend graduate school at CMU was the program's concentration in the teaching of college mathematics. As part of that focus, Ph.D. students are required to complete two teaching internships - during which we are the independent instructor of an upper-level mathematics course under the daily mentorship of a faculty member. I completed internships in MTH 223: Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory with <a href="https://www.cmich.edu/colleges/cst/math/fac_staff/Pages/Meera-MainKar.aspx">Dr. Meera Mainkar</a> and MTH 334: Differential Equations with <a href="https://www.cmich.edu/colleges/cst/math/fac_staff/Pages/Leela-Rakesh.aspx">Dr. Leela Rakesh</a>.</p>
                
                <p>During the Spring 2015 semester, I completed my first teaching internship in MTH 223: Linear Algebra & Matrix Theory with <a href="https://www.cmich.edu/colleges/cst/math/fac_staff/Pages/Meera-MainKar.aspx">Dr. Meera Mainkar</a>. In the Fall 2015 semester, I completed my second internship.  This will be in MTH 334: Differential Equations, and my mentor will be <a href="https://www.cmich.edu/colleges/cst/math/fac_staff/Pages/Leela-Rakesh.aspx">Dr. Leela Rakesh</a>.</p>
