        <h1>Background</h1>

        <p>I grew up in metro Detroit; and while I've adopted the city of Chicago as home, I will always be a Michigander. In 2011, I received a BS from <a href="http://www.emich.edu/">Eastern Michigan University</a> with majors in mathematics and general science and a minor in economics. After that, I moved to Mount Pleasant and began working on a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a concentration in the teaching of college mathematics at Central Michigan University. I successfully defended my dissertation in September 2017. During the 2017-18 academic year, I worked as an Accelerate mathematics instructor at the <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/">South Carolina Governor's School for Science & Mathematics</a>; however, I was eager to return to the Midwest - which brought me to Chicago.</p>

        <!--<h1>Math-Related Activities</h1>-->

        <!--<p>I make it a priority to be an active member of whatever mathematics community I am currently a part of.  In particular, I have been involved with the following student organizations:</p>-->

        <!--<ul>
            <li><a href="http://cmich.orgsync.com/org/amsgradcmich">AMS Graduate Student Chapter</a>: Founding Treasurer during the Spring 2015 semester, and President from Fall 2015 until Spring 2017.  (If the website design seems familiar, it's because I built that one too.)</li>
            <li>Math Club at EMU: Founding Vice President during my junior year, and then President until I graduated in Spring 2011.</li>
        </ul>-->

        <!--<p>I'm also affiliated with the following professional organizations:</p>-->
        <!--<ul style="overflow: hidden;">

        <!--<h1>Other Activities</h1>-->

        <p>Despite being a self-admitted workaholic, I recognize how important it is to do non-work-related things. Here are some of my non-academic interests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Traveling: I first caught the "travel bug" when I studied abroad for a semester at the <a href="https://www.derby.ac.uk/">University of Derby</a>. Since then, I've taken advantage of any travel opportunity that comes way. In fact, the picture on the Home page is from when I was in Melbourne, Australia during a recent spring break.</li>
            <li>Board Games: I've recently discovered an interest in board games. My two favorites currently are <a href="https://cephalofair.com/pages/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a> and <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/">Wingspan</a>.</li>
            <li>Common Ground: Common Ground is SC GSSM's gender and sexual minorities organization. I didn't serve as their official faculty advisor, but I did attend their meetings and contribute whenever I was able to do so.</li>
            <li>Central Harmony A Cappella: I sang in CMU's co-ed competitive a cappella group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralharmony.cmich">Central Harmony</a> for three years, serving as its Business Manager for two of those years.</li>
            <li>Community Theater: I've performed in shows at the <a href="http://friendsofthebroadway.org/">Broadway Theatre</a> in Mount Pleasant, the <a href="http://www.chelseaareaplayers.org/chelseaareaplayers/HOME.html">Chelsea Area Players</a> in Chelsea, and as part of the (now defunct) Beneath the Trap Door Production company in metro Detroit.</li>
            <li>Choral Singing: While at EMU, I spent time singing in the University Choir, the Chamber Choir, and the Vocal Jazz Group.</li>
            <li>Boy Scouts of America: Although I'm no longer active, I did earn the rank of Eagle Scout when in high school.</li>
        </ul>
