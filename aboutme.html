        <h1>Background</h1>

        <p>I grew up in metro Detroit and will always consider that area to be my home. Since then, I have spent most of my time in other Michigan cities - with the exception of a semester abroad in the United Kingdom at the <a href="http://www.derby.ac.uk/">University of Derby</a> during my undergraduate career.</p>

        <p>In 2011, I received a BS from <a href="http://www.emich.edu/">Eastern Michigan University</a> with majors in mathematics and general science and a minor in economics. After that, I moved to Mount Pleasant and began working on a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a concentration in the teaching of college mathematics at CMU. I successfully defended my dissertation in September 2017, and I currently work as an Accelerate mathematics instructor at <a href="https://www.scgssm.org/">The South Carolina Governor's School for Science & Mathematics</a>.</p>

        <h1>Math-Related Activities</h1>

        <p>I make it a priority to be an active member of whatever mathematics community I am currently a part of.  In particular, I have been involved with the following student organizations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://cmich.orgsync.com/org/amsgradcmich">AMS Graduate Student Chapter</a>: Founding Treasurer during the Spring 2015 semester, and President from Fall 2015 until Spring 2017.  (If the website design seems familiar, it's because I built that one too.)</li>
            <li>Math Club at EMU: Founding Vice President during my junior year, and then President until I graduated in Spring 2011.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I'm also affiliated with the following professional organizations:</p>
        <ul style="overflow: hidden;">
            <li><a href="http://www.ams.org/home/page">American Mathematical Society (AMS)</a>: member since 2010.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.maa.org/">Mathematical Association of America (MAA)</a>: member since 2015.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.siam.org/">Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM)</a>: member since 2013.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.ncsss.org/">The National Consortium of Secondary STEM Schools (NCSSS)</a>: member since 2017.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Other Activities</h1>

        <p>Frankly, I think I might go crazy if all I did was teach and reseach mathematics.  In an effort to avoid a psychiatric institution, I make time for other activites.</p>

        <p>Here are some of the highlights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Common Ground: Common Ground is SCGSSM's gender and sexual minorities organization. I don't serve as their official faculty advisor, but I do attend their meetings and contribute whenever I am able to do so.</li>
            <li>Central Harmony A Cappella: I sang in CMU's co-ed competitive a cappella group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/centralharmony.cmich">Central Harmony</a> for three years, serving as its Business Manager for two of those years.</li>
            <li>Community Theater: I've performed in shows at the <a href="http://friendsofthebroadway.org/">Broadway Theatre</a> in Mount Pleasant, the <a href="http://www.chelseaareaplayers.org/chelseaareaplayers/HOME.html">Chelsea Area Players</a> in Chelsea, and as part of the (now defunct) Beneath the Trap Door Production company in metro Detroit.</li>
            <li>Choral Singing: While at EMU, I spent time singing in the University Choir, the Chamber Choir, and the Vocal Jazz Group.</li>
            <li>Boy Scouts of America: Although I'm no longer active, I am a proud Eagle Scout.</li>
        </ul>
